# Edsger

Concatenative programming language.

Useful scripts in this directory:
- `egi`: interactive repl (= `node edsger.js /path/to/lib/directory repl`)
- `egc <src> <dst>`: compile `<src>` to bytecode (= `node edsger.js /path/to/lib/directory compile <src> <dst>`)
- `egd <src>`: disassemble bytecode (= `node edsger.js /path/to/lib/directory disassemble <src>`)
- `eg <src>`: run compiled bytecode (= `node edsger.js /path/to/lib/directory run <src>`)

## Basics

```bash
# line comment
```

Simple values (string and numeric literals) are just pushed onto the stack.
```bash
do 1 2 3
# [1,2,3]
```

Function application is postfix:
```bash
do "hello, " "world" ++
# ["hello, world"]
```

## Functions

Define functions using `≡` or `==`:
```bash
0 tri ≡ 0
n tri ≡ n [n 1 -] tri + # square brackets are superfluous; just for visual grouping

do 100 tri
# [5050]
```

Define multiple cases at once by chaining equations together:
```scheme
0 even? ≡ 1 odd? ≡ true
1 even? ≡ 0 odd? ≡ false
n even? ≡ n 1 - odd?
n odd? ≡ n 1 - even?
```

Quote by wrapping code in parentheses:
```bash
do (1 +)
# [[3,0,0,0,1,15]]
```
The output shown is the compiled bytecode.

Unquote using the function application operator `.`:
```bash
do 1 (1 +) .
# [2]
```

Define and apply an anonymous function with `λ` or `\` and `→` or `->`:
```bash
do 1 2 λ a b → b a
# [2,1]
```

Anonymous functions can also have multiple cases:
```bash
do 1 λ 0 → "zero"
       _ → "something else"
# ["something else"]
```

## Data types

Define tagged variant types with `data`.

e.g. a boolean data type:
```haskell
data true | false
```

The type doesn't really have an explicit name, but you can pattern match on the tags `true` and `false`:
```haskell
true show ≡ "true"
false show ≡ "false"
```

Tags can also take arguments. e.g. an option type:
```haskell
data _ itself | nothing
```

If the underscore is replaced with an identifier, the compiler will automatically generate accessors.

e.g. a list:
```haskell
data nil | tail head cons
```
`tail` and `head` are autogenerated partial functions that extract the first and second fields
of a `cons` pair.

## Pattern matching

The primitive types `integer`, `number`, and `string` have corresponding unary tags, which let you match on them
as well:
```haskell
a integer f ≡ "got an integer"
a number f ≡ "got a number"
a string f ≡ "got a string"
_ f ≡ "got something else"
```

Functions can be overloaded just by defining patterns that match on different tags.
e.g. this `map` function works on both lists and options:
```haskell
nothing f map ≡ nothing
a itself f map ≡ a f . itself

nil f map ≡ nil
t h cons f map ≡ t f map h f . cons
```

All pattern matches must be exhaustive--the compiler automatically deduces the smallest possible type that covers all patterns and checks that the patterns are exhaustive with respect to it.

e.g. the lambda expression below has a pattern containing the `nil` tag, so the compiler deduces that it takes a list as input:
```bash
bad ≡ λ nil → 1
# Error:
#   Patterns are not exhaustive:
#     (nil)
#   The following inferred cases are not satisfied:
#     (_? _? cons?)
```

Overloads are handled similarly.

e.g. this lambda expression takes in a list, integer, boolean, or string:
```bash
bad' ≡ λ nil → 1
         1 → 1
         false → 1
         "abc" → 1
# Error:
#   Patterns are not exhaustive:
#     (nil)
#     (1 int)
#     (false)
#     (abc str)
#   The following inferred cases are not satisfied:
#     (_? _? cons?)
#     integer??
#     (true?)?
#     string??
```

This isn't as strong as exhaustiveness checking in strongly typed languages,
but it does help to make sure that all cases you "intended" to consider are covered.

e.g. Changing a data declaration like
```haskell
data true | false
```
to
```haskell
data true | false | dunno
```
will raise compiler errors at the location of every function that needs to be changed in order to handle
the new case.

## Miscellaneous

A `where` clause defines local bindings:
```haskell
n fib ≡ 1 1 n fib' instead where
  _ a instead ≡ a
  a b 0 fib' ≡ a b
  a b n fib' ≡ [a b +] a [n 1 -] fib'
```

The `bytecode` keyword lets you write bytecode directly.
For example, here are definitions of the arithmetic operators:
```haskell
a number b number + ≡ bytecode 9 2 9 1 16
a number b number * ≡ bytecode 9 2 9 1 17
a number b number - ≡ bytecode 9 2 9 1 18
a number b number / ≡ bytecode 9 2 9 1 19
```

A `{lhs | rhs}` comprehension intersperses `rhs` between all but first two items of `lhs`. For example,
```haskell
data nil | tail head cons
do {nil 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 | cons}
```
becomes
```bash
do nil 1 cons 2 cons 3 cons 4 cons 5 cons 6 cons 7 cons 8 cons 9 cons 10 cons
# [a list from 1 to 10]
```
and
```bash
do {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 | + 2 *}
```
becomes
```bash
do 1 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 5 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 7 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 9 + 2 * 10 + 2 *
# [3560]
```

## Whitespace

Edsger is whitespace-sensitive. Most of the rules are adapted from my
[parenthesizer](https://github.com/johnli0135/parenthesizer),
with keywords and semicolons taking the place of opening and closing parentheses.

Use `node edsger.js preprocess <src>` to see how semicolons are inferred from indentation.
